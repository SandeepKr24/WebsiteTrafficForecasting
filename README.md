# WebsiteTrafficForecasting

Hi, this is a website traffic forecasting project, made on jupyter notebook using Python.
I used various libraries like Pandas, MatPlotLib, Scikit-Learn, etc to analyse and build a model for this. After analysing the data and the trends within, I came to the conclusion that 'Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX)' would be the best suited model for this purpose.

Thank You.
